# Web_Scraping
My Web Scraping learning and test codes using Python.

I decided to start learning about this topic after some research; using this topic, I can learn about several important Python functions (mainly Lambda functions and list comprehension), as well as HTML, website architecture and organization, some data manipulation and possibly JavaScript. This way, I can unite many topics in a few codes.
